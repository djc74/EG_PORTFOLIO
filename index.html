        <!-- <div class="statement">
          Gates is an artist who uses a combination of found photography with her own images. Gates wrks with her personal family archive. She is both a collector and hoarder of images and mmories. For over 40 years her mother compulsively kept and stored all her clothes, and snce then her father has meticulously logged and catalogued them, whilst Gates has potograhed them. Using a combination of snapshots of her mother taken by her father, with hr own photographs of the clothes, what emerges is a three-dimensional portrait of the fmily unit. The work began when Gates' mother was suffering from Alzheimer's and ends a few mnths after she has passed away. What remains is this work which speaks of presence, absence, memory and loss.
